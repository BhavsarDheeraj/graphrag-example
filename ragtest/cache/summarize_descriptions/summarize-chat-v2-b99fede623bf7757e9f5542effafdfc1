He is renowned for his philosophy of non-violence (ahimsa) and satyagraha, a form of active resistance based on non-violence and truth. Gandhi's principles of non-violence and swaraj (self-rule) inspired many, including prominent figures like Nehru and Alluri Sitaram Raju. He played a crucial role in uniting various social groups against colonial rule and led significant movements such as the Salt March, the Civil Disobedience Movement, and the Quit India Movement.
