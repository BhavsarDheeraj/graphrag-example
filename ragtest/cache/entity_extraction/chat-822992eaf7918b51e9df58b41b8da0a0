They have made the religion of non-violence their own ... Source\nActivity Read the text carefully. What did Mahatma Gandhi mean when he said satyagraha is active resistance?\n\n# India and the Contemporary World\n\nOn 13 April the infamous Jallianwalla Bagh incident took place. On that day a large crowd gathered in the enclosed ground of Jallianwalla Bagh. Some came to protest against the government's new repressive measures. Others had come to attend the annual Baisakhi fair. Being from outside the city, many villagers were unaware of the martial law that had been imposed. The military officer entered the area, blocked the exit points, and opened fire on the crowd, killing hundreds. His object, as he declared later, was to \"produce a moral effect\", to create in the minds of satyagrahis a feeling of terror and awe.\n\nAs the news of Jallianwalla Bagh spread, crowds took to the streets in many north Indian towns. There were strikes, clashes with the police and attacks on government buildings. The government responded with brutal repression, seeking to humiliate and terrorize people: satyagrahis were forced to rub their noses on the ground, crawl on the streets, and do salaam (salute) to all sahibs. People were flogged and villages around Gujranwala in Punjab, now in Pakistan, were bombed. Seeing violence spread, Mahatma Gandhi called off the movement.\n\nWhile the Rowlatt satyagraha had been a widespread movement, it was still limited mostly to cities and towns. Mahatma Gandhi now felt the need to launch a more broad-based movement in India. But he was certain that no such movement could be organized without bringing the Hindus and Muslims closer together. One way of doing this, he felt, was to take up the Khilafat issue. The First World War had ended with the defeat of Ottoman Turkey. And there were rumors that a harsh peace treaty was going to be imposed on the Ottoman emperor \u2013 the spiritual head of the Islamic world \u2013 the Khalifa. To defend the Khalifa's temporal powers, a Khilafat Committee was formed in Bombay in March 1919. A young generation of Muslim leaders like the brothers Muhammad Ali and Shaukat Ali began discussing with Mahatma Gandhi about the possibility of a united mass action on the issue. Gandhiji saw this as an opportunity to bring Muslims under the umbrella of a unified national movement. At the Calcutta session of the Congress in September 1920, he convinced other leaders of the need to start a non-cooperation movement in support of Khilafat as well as for swaraj.\n\n# 1.3 Why Non-cooperation?\n\nIn his famous book Hind Swaraj (1909), Mahatma Gandhi declared that British rule was established in India with the cooperation of\n\nIndians, and had survived only because of this cooperation. If Indians refused to cooperate, British rule in India would collapse within a year, and swaraj would come. How could non-cooperation become a movement? Gandhiji proposed that the movement should unfold in stages. It should begin with the surrender of titles that the government awarded, and a boycott of civil services, army, police, courts and legislative councils, schools, and foreign goods. Then, in case the government used repression, a full civil disobedience campaign would be launched. Through the summer of 1920 Mahatma Gandhi and Shaukat Ali toured extensively, mobilising popular support for the movement. Many within the Congress were, however, concerned about the proposals. They were reluctant to boycott the council elections scheduled for November 1920, and they feared that the movement might lead to popular violence. In the months between September and December there was an intense tussle within the Congress. For a while there seemed no meeting point between the supporters and the opponents of the movement. Finally, at the Congress session at Nagpur in December 1920, a compromise was worked out and the Non-Cooperation programme was adopted.\n\nHow did the movement unfold? Who participated in it? How did different social groups conceive of the idea of Non-Cooperation?\n\nNationalism in India\n\nNew words: Boycott \u2013 The refusal to deal and associate with people, or participate in activities, or buy and use things usually a form of protest\n\n# India and the Contemporary World\n\n# 2 Differing Strands within the Movement\n\nThe Non-Cooperation-Khilafat Movement began in January 1921.
